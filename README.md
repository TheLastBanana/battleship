There are 3 states in the game:

1. Ship Placement
When you first start a game, you will need to place your ships.
Use the joystick to move the current ship around the screen. Press the black button to rotate the ship. Press the joystick button to place the ship. If a ship cannot be placed in its current position, it will display in red.

2. Aim
Your current view of the enemy's map will be displayed. Grey blocks indicate an unknown spot, red squares indicate a hit, and white squares indicate a miss.
Use the joystick to move your targeting reticle. Press the joystick button to fire.
When you are done viewing the results of your shot, press the joystick button to continue.

3. Wait
Your map will be displayed. Blue blocks indicate an empty spot, red squares indicate an enemy hit, and white squares indicate an enemy miss.
When the enemy fires, your map will be updated and the enemy's shot will be highlighted with a yellow reticle.
When you are done viewing the results of the enemy's shot, press the joystick button to continue.
